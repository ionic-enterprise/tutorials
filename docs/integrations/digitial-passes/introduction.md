Digital passes, also known as mobile passes or mobile tickets, are digital representations of traditional paper-based tickets, coupons, loyalty cards, or other forms of identification that can be stored on a mobile device. Apple Wallet and Google Wallet can be used with a Capacitor application to create, store and manage these digital passes.

# Apple Wallet Passes

Digital passes for Apple Wallet comes in the form of a file format called `pkpass`. 

These can be created, sent as email attachments, downloaded as files or linked in websites. They are generated by your backend server.

As a first step, it is easiest to learn how to [Add a Pass](./apple-wallet-passes/adding.md) before you learn how to [Create a Pass](./apple-wallet-passes/creating.md).

# Google Wallet Passes

Google Wallet has prerequisites for a Google Wallet API issuer account and GCP account (see [documentation](https://developers.google.com/wallet/generic/web/prerequisites)).

In your backend you will [authenticate and authorize](https://developers.google.com/wallet/generic/web) and [create a pass object](https://developers.google.com/wallet/generic/web#creating_a_passes_object).

In your application you can [add a pass to Google Wallet](https://developers.google.com/wallet/generic/web#saving_to) which will generate a JWT token which can then be used in a "Add to Google Wallet" link which is in the format:
`https://pay.google.com/gp/v/save/{token}`.
