Ionic Portals is a supercharged WebView component that enables native and web teams to better collaborate to bring new and existing web experiences to native mobile apps in a safe, controlled way. With <a href="https://ionic.io/docs/portals" target="_blank">Portals</a>, organizations can achieve micro frontend use cases in native mobile apps, from supplementing existing apps with web-based features to creating superapps that utilize a lightweight native shell as a gateway to web-based micro experiences. Unlike traditional WebView components, web experiences displayed through Portals are bundled within the native binary, can communicate with the host native code, and can be updated over-the-air (without additional store deployments).

This training is designed to get developers familiarized with Portals, covering the following topics:

- Adding Portals to existing projects
- Communicating between web and native code
- Tooling-enhanced development workflows

Developing with Portals differs between web development and native mobile development. Separate training modules have been written for [web](../training/web/overview), [iOS](../training/ios/overview), and [Android](../training/android/overview). While iOS and Android training modules are conceptually identical, they contain platform-specific instructions.
