Ionic Portals is a supercharged WebView component that enables native and web teams to better collaborate to bring new and existing web experiences to native mobile apps in a safe, controlled way. With <a href="https://ionic.io/docs/portals" target="_blank">Portals</a>, organizations can achieve micro frontend use cases in native mobile apps, from supplementing existing apps with web-based features to creating superapps that utilize a lightweight native shell as a gateway to web-based micro experiences. Unlike traditional WebView components, web experiences displayed through Portals are bundled within the native binary, can communicate with the host native code, and can be updated over-the-air (without additional store deployments).

In this training, you will learn the basics of Portals by enhancing an existing application to do the following:

- Adding Portals to a web and/or native mobile project
- Communicate between web and native mobile code
- Improve the development workflow using the Portals CLI

Developing with Portals differs between web development and native mobile development. Separate training modules have been written for [web](../training/web/overview), [iOS](../training/ios/overview), and [Android](../training/android/overview). Although iOS and Android training modules share conceptual similarities, they contain platform-specific instructions.

## Prerequisites

In order to run Portals, you will need an active <a href="https://ionic.io/docs/portals/getting-started#using-your-product-key" target="_blank">Portals product key</a>.

The source code for this training is available <a href="https://github.com/ionic-enterprise/tutorials-and-training-portals" target="_blank">on GitHub</a> and can be cloned with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionic-enterprise/tutorials-and-training-portals.git
```

This training uses the <a href="https://ionic.io/docs/portals/cli/overview" target="_blank">Portals CLI</a>, a tool that helps simplify Portals development and deployment workflows. The command-line is not required to use Portals; however, no alternative workflows will be transcribed as part of this training. Web developers should have either <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode</a> or <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android Studio</a> to make use of the Portals CLI.

Once the prerequisites have been satisfied, continue to the training module aligned with your development skill set.
